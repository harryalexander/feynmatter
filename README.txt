Feynmatter is a chrome extension that applies more legible CSS styling to The
Feynman Lectures.

It is currently not available in the Chrome store, but you can run it by:

1. Cloning this repo by typing
   `git clone https://github.com/harryalexander/feynmatter.git` in your terminal
2. Opening Chrome
3. Navigating to your Chrome Extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions` in
   your Chrome URL bar
4. Toggling Developer Mode on if it's off
5. Clicking `Load Unpacked`
6. Selecting the folder you just cloned in step 1
7. Visit The Feynman Lectures website and enjoy! The styles are applied 
   automatically

NOTE: If you'd like to turn off the styling or disable the extension, you can
simply navigate to your Chrome Extensions page as before and toggle the blue 
switch in the Feynmatter box
